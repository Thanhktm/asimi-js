Asimi JS
========

Asimi JS is a node.js based project that I created to control my [Asimi bot](http://hardwarefun.com/projects/asimi) using JavaScript. I created this project as a demo for my talk at jsFoo 2012.

## Source code

The source code for the entire project is in my [github account](https://github.com/sudar/Asimi-js).

## License

The source code and the config files are released under "THE BEER-WARE" license.

I would, however, consider it a great courtesy if you could email me and tell me about your project and how this code was used, just for my own continued personal gratification :)

You can also find other ways to [make me happy](http://sudarmuthu.com/if-you-wanna-thank-me), if you liked this project ;)

## Coming soon

More modules, better documentation, demo videos, photos, building instructions etc..
